----> ADVİCE
 During my testing of the search functionality on a search engine,
 I found an issue where the search engine was not able to accurately
 return search results for queries with multiple keywords. While searches
 for a single keyword worked fine, searches with multiple keywords returned
 articles that only contained some of the keywords, rather than all of them.

To address this issue, I recommend the following:

Review the search engine algorithm to ensure that it can accurately match
articles to queries with multiple keywords.

Implement a system that weights articles with all the keywords higher than
those with only some of the keywords.

Consider implementing machine learning or natural language processing tools
to assist with the search process and ensure greater accuracy.

Add a feedback mechanism for users to report any search-related issues,
such as inaccurate or irrelevant search results.

By taking these steps, you can ensure that all users have access to accurate
and relevant search results, regardless of the number of keywords in their query,
which will enhance the user experience and increase engagement with the search engine.



--------> Exploratory Test Charter.
 * Test for the language options in the contents menu on Wikipedia:
 * Feature under test: Language options in the contents menu
 * Test scope: Language selection options and functionality
 * Test objective: Identify any issues or errors related to language
 * selection and verify the accuracy of language translation in the contents menu
 * Test team: QA analyst, linguist
 * Test duration: 1 day, on May 7, 2023
 * Reporting: Test report including any identified issues with language selection
 * and translation accuracy in the contents menu, with recommendations for improvement.

ADVİCE
During my testing of the language options in the contents menu on Wikipedia, I found an
issue where some parts of the page remained in English despite selecting a different language.
This is likely due to incomplete translation of the content into the selected language.

To address this issue, I recommend the following:

Conduct a thorough review of all content on the site to ensure that it is accurately
translated into all available languages.

Implement a regular review process for new content to ensure that it is translated promptly
and accurately.

Add a feedback mechanism for users to report any language-related issues, such as
incorrect translations or missing translations.

Consider implementing machine learning or natural language processing tools to assist
with the translation process and ensure greater accuracy.

By taking these steps, you can ensure that all users have access to accurate,
high-quality content in their preferred language, which will enhance the user
experience and increase engagement with the site.
